Always ensure consistent unit usage within your `calc()` expressions. If you are adding or subtracting values, they must all have the same unit.  If multiplying or dividing, ensure the units result in the expected unit for the final value.

Example of Corrected Code:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```
In this example, both `100%` and `20px` are explicitly defined with units and the calculation correctly results in a width value with `px` units.
